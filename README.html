<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In this assignment, we will be implementing a simplified version of the method
in &#8220;Poisson Surface Reconstruction&#8221; by Kazhdan et al. 2006. (Your first &#8220;task&#8221;
will be to read and understand this paper).</p>

<p>Many scanning technologies output a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> point samples <span class="math">\(\P\)</span> on the
surface of the object in question. From these points and perhaps the location
of the camera, one can also estimate normals <span class="math">\(\N\)</span> to the surface for each point
<span class="math">\(\p ∈ \P\)</span>.</p>

<p>For shape analysis, visualization and other downstream geometry processing
phases, we would like to convert this finitely sampled <em>point cloud</em> data into
an <em>explicit continuous surface representation</em>: i.e., a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation%5F(topology)">triangle
mesh</a> (a special case
of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon%5Fmesh">polygon mesh</a>).</p>

<h3 id="voxel-basedimplicitsurface">Voxel-based Implicit Surface</h3>

<p>Converting the point cloud directly to a triangle mesh makes it very difficult
to ensure that the mesh meets certain <em>topological</em> postconditions: i.e., that
it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise%5Flinear%5Fmanifold">manifold</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Manifold%5Fwith%5Fboundary">closed</a>,
and has a small number of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus%5F(mathematics)">holes</a>.</p>

<p>Instead we will first convert the point cloud <em>sampling representation</em> into a
an <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit%5Fsurface">implicit surface
representation</a></em>: where the
unknown surface is defined as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level%5Fset">level-set</a> of some function <span class="math">\(g: \R³
→ \R\)</span> mapping all points in space to a scalar value. For example, we may define
the surface <span class="math">\(∂\S\)</span> of some solid, volumetric shape <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> to be all points <span class="math">\(\x ∈
\R³\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(g(x) = σ\)</span>, where we may arbitrarily set <span class="math">\(σ=½\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∂\S = \{\x ∈ \R³ | g(\x)  = σ\}.
\]</span></p>

<p>On the computer, it is straightforward
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization">discretize</a> an implicit
function. We define a regular 3D grid of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxels</a> containing at least the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum%5Fbounding%5Fbox">bounding
box</a> of <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>. At each
node in the grid <span class="math">\(\x_{i,j,k}\)</span> we store the value of the implicit function
<span class="math">\(g(\x_{i,j,k})\)</span>. This defines <span class="math">\(g\)</span> <em>everywhere</em> in the grid via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilinear_interpolation">trilinear
interpolation</a>. </p>

<figure>
<img src="images/trilinear-interpolation.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>For example, consider a point <span class="math">\(\x = (⅓,¼,½)\)</span> lying in the middle of the
bottom-most, front-most, left-most cell. We know the values at the eight
corners. Trilinear interpolation can be understood as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">linear
interpolation</a> in the
<span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction by <span class="math">\(⅓\)</span> on each <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis-aligned edge, resulting in four values
<em>living</em> on the same plane. These can then be linearly interpolated in the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
direction by <span class="math">\(¼\)</span> resulting in two points on the same line, and finally in the
<span class="math">\(z\)</span> direction by <span class="math">\(½\)</span> to get to our evaluation point <span class="math">\((⅓,¼,½)\)</span>.</p>

<p>An implicit surface stored as the level-set of a trilinearly interpolated grid
can be <em>contoured</em> into a triangle mesh via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching&amp;5Fcubes">Marching Cubes
Algorithm</a>.
For the purposes of this assignment, we will treat this as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%5Fbox">black
box</a>. Instead, we focus on
determining what values for <span class="math">\(g\)</span> to store on the grid.</p>

<h2 id="characteristicfunctionsofsolids">Characteristic functions of solids</h2>

<p>We assume that our set of points <span class="math">\(\P\)</span> lie on the surface <span class="math">\(∂\S\)</span> of some physical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid">solid</a> object <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>. This solid object
must have some non-trivial volume that we can calculate <em>abstractly</em> as the
integral of unit density over the solid:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∫\limits_\S 1 \;dA.                                                        %_
\]</span></p>

<p>We can rewrite this definite integral as an indefinite integral over all of
<span class="math">\(\R^3\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∫\limits_{\R³} χ_\S(\x) \;dA,
\]</span></p>

<p>by introducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator%5Ffunction">characteristic
function</a> of <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>, that is
<em>one</em> for points inside of the shape and <em>zero</em> for points outside of <span class="math">\(\S\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
χ_\S(\x) = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{ if $\x ∈ \S$ } \\
  0 & \text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}                                                             %_
\]</span></p>

<p>Compared to typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit%5Fsurface">implicit surface
functions</a>, this function
represents the surface <span class="math">\(∂\S\)</span> of the shape <span class="math">\(\S\)</span> as the <em>discontinuity</em> between
the one values and the zero values. Awkwardly, the gradient of the
characteristic function <span class="math">\(∇χ_\S\)</span> is <em>not defined</em> along <span class="math">\(∂\S\)</span>.</p>

<p>One of the key observations made in [Kazhdan et al. 2006] is that the gradient
of a infinitesimally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollifier">mollified</a>
(smoothed) characteristic function: </p>

<ol>
<li>points in the direction of the normal near the surface <span class="math">\(∂\S\)</span>, and</li>
<li>is zero everywhere else.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our goal will be to use our points <span class="math">\(\P\)</span> and normals <span class="math">\(\N\)</span> to <em>optimize</em> an
implicit function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> over a regular grid, so that its gradient <span class="math">\(∇g\)</span> meets
these two criteria. In that way, our <span class="math">\(g\)</span> will be an approximation of the
mollified characteristic function.</p>

<h2 id="poissonsurfacereconstruction">Poisson surface reconstruction</h2>

<h3 id="or:howilearnedtostopworryingandminimizesquaredgradients">Or: how I learned to stop worrying and minimize squared Gradients</h3>

<p><span id=assumptions>
Let us start by making two assumptions:
</span></p>

<ol>
<li>we know how to compute <span class="math">\(∇g\)</span> at each node location <span class="math">\(\x_{i,j,k}\)</span>, and</li>
<li>our input points <span class="math">\(\P\)</span> all lie perfectly at grid nodes:
 <span class="math">\(∃\ \x_{i,j,k} = \p_ℓ\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We will find out these assumptions are not realistic and we will have to relax
them (i.e., we <strong><em>will not</em></strong> make these assumptions in the completion of the
tasks). However, it will make the following algorithmic description easier on
the first pass.</p>

<p>If our points <span class="math">\(\P\)</span> lie at grid points, then our corresponding normals <span class="math">\(\N\)</span> also
<em>live</em> at grid points. This leads to a very simple set of linear equations to
define a function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> with a gradient equal to the surface normal at the
surface and zero gradient away from the surface:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∇g(\x_{i,j,k}) = \v_{i,j,k} := \begin{cases}
  \vphantom{\left(\begin{array}{c}0\\0\\0\end{array}\right)}
  \n_ℓ & \text{ if $∃\ \p_ℓ = \x_{i,j,k}$}, \\
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    0\\
    0\\
    0\end{array}\right) & \text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>

<p>This is a <em>vector-valued</em> equation. The gradients, normals and zero-vectors are
three-dimensional (e.g., <span class="math">\(∇g ∈ \R³\)</span>). In effect, this is <em>three equations</em> for
every grid node.</p>

<p>Since we only need a single number at each grid node (the value of <span class="math">\(g\)</span>), we
have <em>too many</em> equations.</p>

<p>Like many geometry processing algorithms confronted with such an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermined%5Fsystem">over
determined</a>, we will
<em>optimize</em> for the solution that best <em>minimizes</em> the error of equation:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
‖ ∇g(\x_{i,j,k})  - \v_{i,j,k}‖².
\]</span></p>

<p>We will treat the error of each grid location equally by minimizing the sum
over all grid locations:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_\g ∑_i ∑_j ∑_k ½ ‖ ∇g(\x_{i,j,k})  - \v_{i,j,k}‖²,
\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(\g\)</span> (written in boldface) is a vector of <em>unknown</em> grid-nodes values,
where <span class="math">\(g_{i,j,k} = g(\x_{i,j,k})\)</span>. </p>

<p>Part of the convenience of working on a regular grid is that we can use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method">finite difference
method</a> to approximate
the gradient <span class="math">\(∇g\)</span> on the grid.</p>

<p>After revisiting <a href="#assumptions">our assumptions</a>, we will be able to compute
approximations of
the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>-components of <span class="math">\(∇g\)</span> via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse%5Fmatrix">sparse
matrix</a> multiplication of
a &#8220;gradient matrix&#8221; <span class="math">\(\G\)</span> and our vector of unknown grid values <span class="math">\(\g\)</span>. We will be
able to write the
minimization problem above in matrix form:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_\g ½ ‖ \G \g - \v ‖²,
\]</span></p>

<p>or equivalently after expanding the norm:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\min_\g ½ \g^\transpose \G^\transpose \G \g - \g^\transpose \G^\transpose \v + \text{constant},
\]</span></p>

<p>This is a quadratic &#8220;energy&#8221; function of the variables of <span class="math">\(\g\)</span>, its minimum occurs when
an infinitesimal change in <span class="math">\(\g\)</span> produces no change in the energy:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\frac{∂}{∂\g} ½ \g^\transpose \G^\transpose \G \g - \g^\transpose \G^\transpose \v = 0.
\]</span></p>

<p>Applying this derivative gives us a <em>sparse</em> system of linear equations</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\G^\transpose \G \g = \G^\transpose \v.
\]</span></p>

<p>We will assume that we can solve this using a black box sparse solver.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s revisit <a href="#assumptions">our assumptions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gradientsonaregulargrid">Gradients on a regular grid</h3>

<p>The gradient of a function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> in 3D is nothing more than a vector containing
partial derivatives in each coordinate direction:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∇g(\x) = \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \frac{∂g(\x)}{∂x} \\
    \frac{∂g(\x)}{∂y} \\
    \frac{∂g(\x)}{∂z}
  \end{array}\right).
\]</span></p>

<p>We will approximate each partial derivative individually. Let&#8217;s consider the
partial derivative in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> direction, <span class="math">\(∂g(\x)/∂x\)</span>, and we will assume
without loss of generality that what we derive applies <em>symmetrically</em> for <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>.</p>

<p>The partial derivative in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction is a one-dimensional derivative.
This couldn&#8217;t be easier to do with finite differences. We approximate the
derivative of the function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> with respect to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> direction is the
difference between the function evaluated at one grid node and at the grid node
<em>before</em> it in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction then divided by the spatial distance between
adjacent nodes <span class="math">\(h\)</span> (i.e., the grid step size):</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\frac{∂g(\x_{i-½,j,k})}{∂x} = \frac{g_{i,j,k} - g_{i-1,j,k}}{h},
\]</span></p>

<p>where we use the index <span class="math">\(i-½\)</span> to indicate that this derivative in the
<span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction lives on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staggered%5Fgrid">staggered
grid</a> <em>in between</em> the grid
nodes where the function values for <span class="math">\(g\)</span>.</p>

<p>The following pictures show a 2D example, where <span class="math">\(g\)</span> lives on the nodes of a
5×5 blue grid:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/primary-grid.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The partial derivatives of <span class="math">\(g\)</span> with respect to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction <span class="math">\(∂g(\x)/∂x\)</span>
live on a <strong>4</strong>×5 green, staggered grid:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/staggered-grid-x.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>The partial derivatives of <span class="math">\(g\)</span> with respect to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-direction <span class="math">\(∂g(\x)/∂y\)</span>
live on a 5×<strong>4</strong> yellow, staggered grid:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/staggered-grid-x-and-y.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>Letting <span class="math">\(\g ∈ \R^{n_xn_yn_z × 1}\)</span> be column vector of function values on the
<em>primary grid</em> (blue in the example pictures), we can construct a sparse matrix
<span class="math">\(\D^x ∈ \R^{(n_x-1)n_yn_z × n_xn_yn_z}\)</span> so that each row <span class="math">\(\D^x_{i-½,j,k} ∈
\R^{1 × n_xn_yn_z}\)</span> computes the partial derivative at the corresponding
staggered grid location <span class="math">\(\x_{i-½,j,k}\)</span>. The $ℓ$th entry in that row receives a
value only for neighboring primary grid nodes:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\D^x_{i-½,j,k}(ℓ) = 
  \begin{cases}
  -1 & \text{ if $ℓ = i-1$ }\\
   1 & \text{ if $ℓ = i$ }\\
   0 & \text{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}.
\]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="indexing3darrays">Indexing 3D arrays</h4>

<p>Now, obviously in our code we cannot <em>index</em> the column vector <span class="math">\(\g\)</span> by a
triplet of numbers <span class="math">\(\{i,j,k\}\)</span> or the rows of <span class="math">\(\D^x\)</span> by the triplet
<span class="math">\({i-½,j,k}\)</span>. We will assume that <span class="math">\(\g_{i,j,k}\)</span> refers to
<code>g(i+j*n_x+k*n_y*n_x)</code>. Similarly, for the staggered grid subscripts
<span class="math">\({i-½,j,k}\)</span> we will assume that <span class="math">\(\D^x_{i-½,j,k}(ℓ)\)</span> refers to the matrix
entry <code>Dx(i+j*n_x+k*n_y*n_x,l)</code>, where the <span class="math">\(i-½\)</span> has been <em>rounded down</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can similarly build matrices <span class="math">\(\D^y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\D^z\)</span> and <em>stack</em> these matrices
vertically to create a gradient matrix <span class="math">\(\G\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\G = 
\left(\begin{array}{c}
  \D^x \\
  \D^y \\
  \D^z
\end{array}\right)
  ∈ \R^{ \left((n_x-1)n_yn_z + n_x(n_y-1)n_z + n_xn_y(n_z-1)\right)×n_xn_yn_z}
\]</span></p>

<p>This implies that our vector <span class="math">\(\v\)</span> of zeros and normals in our minimization
problem should not <em>live</em> on the primary, but rather it, too, should be broken
into <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>-components that live of their resepctive staggered
grids:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\v = 
\left(\begin{array}{c}
  \v^x \\
  \v^y \\
  \v^z 
\end{array}\right)
  ∈ \R^{ \left((n_x-1)n_yn_z + n_x(n_y-1)n_z + n_xn_y(n_z-1)\right)×1}.
\]</span></p>

<p>This leads to addressing our second assumption.</p>

<h3 id="b-b-b-b-buttheinputnormalsmightnotbeatgridnodelocations">B-b-b-b-but the input normals might not be at grid node locations?</h3>

<p>At this point, we would <em>actually</em> liked to have had that our input normals
were given component-wise on the staggered grid. Then we could immediate stick
them into <span class="math">\(\v\)</span>. But this doesn&#8217;t make much sense as each normal <span class="math">\(\n_ℓ\)</span> <em>lives</em>
at its associated point <span class="math">\(\p_ℓ\)</span>, regardless of any grids.</p>

<p>To remedy this, we will distribute each component of each input normal <span class="math">\(\n_ℓ\)</span>
to <span class="math">\(\v\)</span> at the corresponding staggered grid node location.</p>

<p>For example, consider the normal <span class="math">\(\n\)</span> at some point <span class="math">\(\x_{1,¼,½}\)</span>. Conceptually,
we&#8217;ll think of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-component of the normal <span class="math">\(n_x\)</span> as floating in the
staggered grid corresponding to <span class="math">\(\D^x\)</span>, in between the eight staggered grid
locations:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
\x_{½,0,0},  \\
\x_{1½,0,0},   \\
\x_{½,1,0},  \\
\x_{1½,1,0},   \\
\x_{½,0,1},  \\
\x_{1½,0,1},   \\
\x_{½,1,1}, \text{ and } \\
\x_{1½,1,1}
\]</span></p>

<p>Each of these staggered grid nodes has a corresponding <span class="math">\(x\)</span> value in the vector
<span class="math">\(\v^x\)</span>.</p>

<p>We will distribute <span class="math">\(n_x\)</span> to these entries in <span class="math">\(\v^x\)</span> by <em>adding</em> a partial amount
of <span class="math">\(n_x\)</span> to each. I.e., </p>

<p><span class="math">\[
v^x_{½,0,0}  = w_{ ½,0,0}\left(\x_{1,¼,½}\right)\ n_x,  \\
v^x_{1½,0,0} = w_{1½,0,0}\left(\x_{1,¼,½}\right)\ n_x,  \\
\vdots \\
v^x_{1½,1,1} = w_{1½,1,1}\left(\x_{1,¼,½}\right)\ n_x.
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\(w_{iِ+½,j,k}(\p)\)</span> is the trilinear interpolation <em>weight</em> associate with
staggered grid node <span class="math">\(\x_{iِ+½,j,k}\)</span> to interpolate a value at the point <span class="math">\(\p\)</span>.
The trilinear interpolation weights so that:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
n_x =   \\
  w_{ ½,0,0}( \x_{1,¼,½} ) \  v^x_{ ½,0,0} +  \\
  w_{1½,0,0}( \x_{1,¼,½} ) \  v^x_{1½,0,0} +  \\
  \vdots \\
  w_{1½,1,1}( \x_{1,¼,½} )\ v^x_{1½,1,1}.
\]</span></p>

<p>Since we need to do these for the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-component of each input normal, we will
assemble a sparse matrix <span class="math">\(\W^x ∈ n × (n_x-1)n_yn_z\)</span> that <em>interpolates</em>
<span class="math">\(\v^x\)</span> at each point <span class="math">\(\p\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
  ( \W^x \v^x ) ∈ \R^{n×1}
\]</span></p>

<p>the transpose of <span class="math">\(\W^x\)</span> is not quite its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix"><em>inverse</em></a>, but instead can
be interpreted as <em>distributing</em> values onto staggered grid locations where
<span class="math">\(\v^x\)</span> lives:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
  \v^x = (\W^x)^\transpose \N^x.
\]</span></p>

<p>Using this definition of <span class="math">\(\v^x\)</span> and analogously for <span class="math">\(\v^y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\v^z\)</span> we can
construct the vector <span class="math">\(\v\)</span> in our energy minimization problem above.</p>

<p>Notice that if we interpret the transpose of our gradient matrix
<span class="math">\(\G^\transpose\)</span> as a <em>divergence matrix</em> (we can and we should), then the
structure of these smooth energies and equations are directly preserved in
our discrete energies and equations.</p>

<p>This kind of <em>structure preservation</em> is a major criterion for judging
discrete methods.</p>

<p>Constant functions have no gradient. This means that we can add a constant
function to our implicit function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> without changing its gradient:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
∇g = ∇(g+c) = ∇g + ∇c = ∇g + 0.
\]</span></p>

<p>The same is true for our discrete gradient matrix <span class="math">\(\G\)</span>: if the vector of grid
values <span class="math">\(\g\)</span> is constant then <span class="math">\(\G \g\)</span> will be a vector zeros.</p>

<p>This is potentially problematic for our least squares solve: there are many
solutions, since we can just add a constant. Fortunately, we <em>don&#8217;t really
care</em>. It&#8217;s elegant to say that our surface is defined at <span class="math">\(g=0\)</span>, but we&#8217;d be
just as happy declaring that our surface is defined at <span class="math">\(g=c\)</span>.</p>

<p>To this end we just need to find <em>a solution</em> <span class="math">\(\g\)</span>, and then to pick a good
iso-value <span class="math">\(σ\)</span>.</p>

<p>As suggested in [Kazhdan et al. 2006], we can pick a good iso-value by
interpolating our solution <span class="math">\(\g\)</span> at each of the input points (since we know
they&#8217;re on the surface) and averaging their values. In matrix form using our
interpolation matrix <span class="math">\(\W\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[
σ = \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}^\transpose \W \g,
\]</span></p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(\mathbf{1} ∈ \R^{n×1}\)</span> is a vector of ones.</p>

<p>Besides the insights above, a major contribution of [Kazhdan et al. 2006] was
to setup and solve this problem on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_mesh_refinement">adaptive
grid</a> rather than a
regular grid. They also track &#8220;confidence&#8221; of their input data effecting how
they smooth and interpolate values. As a result, their method is one of the
most highly used surface reconstruction techniques to this day.</p>
